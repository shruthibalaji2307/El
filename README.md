# El
El (Eleven) is a cricket player recommendation system. For the combination of players you choose, it simulates a match between the chosen team and the selected opposition and calculates the probability of success.   It recommends players to be selected based on how much they contribute to the success. It calculates weighted scores for bowlers, fielders, batsmen and wicket keepers based on the past 10 years of ICC test cricket data.  Applications: Team selectors can use the simulator and calculate the probability of success for each combination of players. Friends can compete against each other by forming their own teams and seeing which team gets the higher probability of a win.
